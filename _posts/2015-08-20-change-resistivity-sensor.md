These instructions are for changing the cleaning chamber resistivity sensor in ABC-2500 machines where the sensor is located in the spray loop:

1. Power Off the machine.
2. Open the Operator Interface panel to gain access to the front Electrical Panel.
3. Locate the Chamber Resistivity Board (RESIST403) at the top right of the panel.

4. Remove the sensor wires from the terminal block. To release each wire press on the orange lever while gently pulling on the wire.
5. Remove the rear panels to gain access to the spray loop and the resistivity sensor.

6. Unscrew the black compression nut and remove the sensor.
7. The sensor cable can now be removed from the machine.
8. Insert the new sensor into the fitting and tighten the compression nut.
9. Route the new sensor cable to the front Electrical Panel.
10. Insert the sensor wires into the Resistivity Board. The terminal block is labeled with the wire colors. Press down the orange lever and insert the wire.
